Correlated subqueries are not supported in Hive.
http://grokbase.com/t/hive/user/1289zqna6n/nested-select-statements
there's no select into
insert into only with select [] from
sometimes that are created and stored as text file in the previous run show as empty https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7368
select from two tables should be done with join
all tables should reside in their own folder, sometimes when multiple tables are the same select does not return anything
update set:(
procedures are not directly supported
autoincrement via udf

insert into fit select id,acs.class, log(pprob) + sum(log(fprob)) score from test t join (select sp.attribute, sp.value, sp.class, sp.pprob, isnull(s.acprob,.001) fprob from (select attrclass.attribute, attrclass.value, priors.class, priors.pprob from attrclass join priors on (priors.class = attrclass.class) group by attrclass.attribute, attrclass.value, priors.class, priors.pprob) sp left join attrclass s on sp.attribute = s.attribute and sp.value = s.value and sp.class = s.class) acs on t.attribute = acs.attribute and t.value = acs.value group by id, acs.class, pprob

insert overwrite table km_data select a.id, b.id cluster_id a.lat, a.lng from km_data a join km_clusters b on a.lat = b.lat and a.lng = b.lng order
